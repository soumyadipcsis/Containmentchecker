Given the following SFC1, modify it to create a new SFC (SFC2).

***Upgraded*** Feature: 

Upgrade rules for Factorial :

    - adds the ability to track the number of loop iterations 
      using the auxiliary variable temp and introduces a cleanup mechanism 
      for resetting temp. (For Factorial) 


   Upgrade rules-R1 for DEC TO HEX :


    -  Uses only integers/arithmetic, ready for direct 
       use in hardware/PLCs. (DEC TO HEX)
  
  
    Upgrade rules-R2 for DEC TO HEX :

    -   The HexValue should be a string, not a number 

    -   Error handling should output "Error" instead of -1

    -  The conversion should accumulate hexadecimal characters as a string


****Use*** the following guidelines to construct SFC2:


steps = [
    { name: StepName1, function: FunctionOrAssignment1 },
    { name: StepName2, function: FunctionOrAssignment2 },
    ...
]

transitions = [
    { src: StepNameX, tgt: StepNameY, guard: GuardCondition1 },
    { src: StepNameY, tgt: StepNameZ, guard: GuardCondition2 },
    ...
]

variables = [ var1, var2, var3, ... ]
initial_step = StepName1
