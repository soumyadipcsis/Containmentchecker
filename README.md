# AntarBhukti

AntarBhukti is a verification tool for evolving software, designed to verify changes between two versions of SFCs (Sequential Function Charts) â€” a source and a target. It is specifically tailored for use with OSCAT application benchmarks.

---

## Features

- **Compare SFCs:** Verifies the correctness of software evolution using textual SFC representations.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple command line interface for fast verification tasks.
- **Benchmark Suite:** Works on all 80 OSCAT benchmark applications.  
  - `Benchmrak-Source-OSCAT.py` contains the source/original SFCs.  
  - `Benchmarks-Upgrade-OSCAT.py` contains the upgraded/target SFCs.
- **Superior Performance:** Outperforms [verifaps](https://formal.kastel.kit.edu/~weigl/verifaps/index.html) in coverage and flexibility.
- **Open ST Reference:** Reference ST code for the OSCAT library is available in the [SamaTulyata4PLC](https://github.com/soumyadipcsis/SamaTulyata4PLC) repository.

## Getting Started

**Dependency files:**  
- `driver.py`  
- `sfc.py`  
- `sfc_verifier.py`
- `genreport.py`
- `setup.py`

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [Z3 SMT solver](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) (Python bindings)

### Usage

```sh
python3 driver.py <source_SFC.txt> <upgraded_SFC.txt>
```
- `<source_SFC.txt>`: Path to the source SFC file.
- `<upgraded_SFC.txt>`: Path to the upgraded (evolved) SFC file.

### Example

```sh
python3 driver.py sfc_old.txt sfc_new.txt
```

## OSCAT Benchmarks

AntarBhukti has been tested on all 80 OSCAT automation benchmarks for robust and reliable verification.
