Add the following logic to SFC2.

Input Format: 

Paths in Model 1 with NO equivalent path in Model 2
From	      To	        Transitions	    Z3 Condition	   Z3 Data Transformation

{non_equiv_paths_str}

Here is the current SFC2 Python code:
{sfc2_code}

Here is the SFC1 Python code for reference:
{sfc1_code}

Please modify steps2 and transitions2 so that all above paths are covered and equivalence will hold. 
Only output valid Python code for steps2 and transitions2, nothing else.
